# CPE551_airfoil
Python programming class project. Plotting flow around an airfoil using the Zhukovsky transform

This script is intended to use the Zhukovsky transformation to plot streamlines over an airfoil. This code is currently under development. 
There are some bugs being worked out regarding plotting the streamlines. 

The purpose behind this script is to help engineers visualize flow over an airfoil.
